    <h1>Chapter 01: introduction to the Linux Foundation and Linux</h1>

    <h2>Linux LFS101x - edX intro to Linux with Jerry Cooperstein, PhD</h2>

    <p>
        Linux Foundation hosts Linux. the Linux Foundation today hosts far more than Linux; it is the umbrella for many critical open source projects</br>
        spanning all industry sectors. Some of the technologies focused on include </br> big data, analytics, networking, embedded systems and IoT, web tools, cloud computing, edge computing, automotive, security, blockchain, and many more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Linux foundation hosts events all over the world
    </p>

    <p>course requirements: a flavor of Linux- Red Hat (including CentOS and Fedora)</br>
        SUSE Family (including openSUSE)</br> Debian Family (including Ubuntu and Linux Mint) --i'm using ubuntu (WSL ubuntu, actually)
    </p>
    <p> Debian, RHEL, and SUSE </p>
    <p>RHEL - Red Hat Enterprise Linux also includes CentOS, Fedora, Oracle Linux. Fedora has additional functionality not included in red hat</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fedora serves as upstream testing platform for RHEL</li>
        <li>CentOS is a close clone of RHEL, while Oracle Linux is a copy of RHEL with some changes</li>
        <li>uses 'yum' and 'dnf' RPM-based yum package managers</li>
        <li>RHEL is widely used by enterprises that host their own systems</li>
    </ul>
    <P>SUSE Family</P>
    <ul>
        <li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) is the upstream for openSUSE</li>
        <li>uses 'zypper' package manager (RRM-based)</li>
        <li>includes YaST (Yet Another Setup Tool) app for sys admin purposes</li>
        <li>SLES is widely used in retail</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Debian Family</br> Ubuntu is the upstream for Linux Mint and a number of other distros. commonly used on server and clients.</br>
        Debian provides the largest and most complete repository of any Linux distro.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Debian is upstrean for Ubuntu and Ubuntu is upstream of Mint, Kubuntu, and many others</li>
        <li>uses 'apt' package manager (which is DPKG-based, NOT RPM-based)</li>
        <li>widely used in cloud deployment</li>
        <li>GNOME under the hood</li>
    </ul>

    <p>summarize the key concepts covered: The Linux Foundation is the umbrella organization for many critical open source projects that power corporations, spanning all industry sectors. Its work today extends far beyond Linux, fostering innovation at every
        layer of the software stack.
        </br>The Linux Foundation training is for the community and by the community. Linux training is distribution-flexible, technically advanced, and created with the leaders of the Linux development community.
        </br>There are three major distribution families within Linux: Red Hat, SUSE and Debian. In this course, we will work with representative members of all of these families throughout.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 02: Linux Philosophy and concepts</h2>
    <p>Linux is the largest open source project in the world</p>
    <p>this is a hands on course and we are going to get hands on with Jerry Cooperstein</p>
    </br>
    <p>in 1991 Linus Torvalds wrote his own operating system kernel and collected together other pieces to complete the OS with his kernel at the center</p>
    </br>
    <p>by 1992 he re-licensed with the GPL (General Public License) by GNU (a project of the FSF [Free Software Foundation]</p>
    </br>
    <p>Linux is constantly updated, enhanced, and maintained by a network of developers for all over the internet.</p>
    <p>there is a huge community to assist with Linux issues</p>
    </br>
    <p>Terminology:</p>
    </br>
    <ul>
        <li>kernel - the lik between hardware and applications, the brain of the Linux OS</li>
        <li>Distro (distrobution) - Red Hat, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc... </li>
        <li>bootloader - boots the OS (2 examples: GRUB and ISOLINUX)</li>
        <li>service - program that runs as a background process (ex: named, httpd, ftpd, dhcpd)</li>
        <li>filesystem - method to store and organize files (ex: Fat, ext3, ext4, XFS, NTFS)</li>
        <li>x windows system - toolkit and protocols to build GUI (ex: desktop environments like GNOME or KDE)</li>
        <li>command line (CLI) - interface for typing commands on top the OS</li>
        <li>shell - is the Command Line Interpreter that interprets instructions entered in the CLI and informs the OS to perform the tasks and commands (ex: bash)</li>
    </ul>
    </br>
    <p>summarize the key concepts covered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linux borrows heavily from Unix</li>
        <li>Features and Services are accessed through files and file-like objects</li>
        <li>fully mult-tasking, multi-usser operating system, built in networking and service process known as daemons</li>
        <li>developed by a collaboration from all over the internet</li>
        <li>common terms: kernel, distrobution, boot loader, service, filesystem, x window system, desktop environment, and command line</li>
        <li>a full distribution consist of the kerner, plus a number of other software tools for file-related operations, user management, and package management</li>
    </ul>
